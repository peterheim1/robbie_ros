# robbie_ros

meta package for robbie
With this package Robbie has more structure as we try to mature the system 
The aim for stage 2 is for Robbie to be a fully autonomous robot able to navigate 
to a target in the house, retrieve or deliver a item without assistance or doing damage
We have made large strides in reliability of software and hardware but more is  still
required
